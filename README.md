## Project description:

A

## Problem domain:

Itâ€™s hard to know what game to choose, I would like a place to go and find a game that is peer reviewed.

## User stories:

As a userâ€¦

- As a user I want to be able to see a selection of games, click on it and see the information.

- As a user I want to be able to leave a review of the game.

- As a user I want this to be optimised for mobile.

- As a user I want to be able to see a carousel of games.

## Stretch goals

- As a user I want to be able to use arrow buttons to cycle through the game images

- As a user I want to be able to filter these games by highest/lowest rated.

- As a user I want there to be smooth transitions throughout the page.

- As a user I would like a menu to be optimised for mobile such as a hamburger menu.
